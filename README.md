* A training log can be added from the users diary "Create a new training log"
* A training log can be added from the workout's description using "Add this workout to the training log"
* Users can edit and remove their own training logs.
* User can search for the WODs created using keywords in the WOD description (not in the warmup or extras, because they are voluntary)
